Hello, I’m Phil. I’m a Web Developer and Creative Producer based in London and sometimes Dublin.

I’m a creative at heart. I’m also a bit of a data and privacy nerd. I aim to wield tech for good.

I’ve been living in London for the last 6 years. In that time I’ve worked with some amazing teams on challenges surrounding [open data](https://theodi.org/) and [privacy / security](https://projectsbyif.com/).

Until recently I was a Developer at [Projects by IF](https://projectsbyif.com/). Right now I’m freelancing as a Developer and Creative Producer while polishing some of my technical skills.

If you're interested and think that you've a role / project you'd like to talk to me about, then drop me a line - [plangphoto@gmail.com](mailto:plangphoto@gmail.com).
