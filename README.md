Hello, I’m Phil. I’m a Web Developer and Creative Producer based in London and sometimes Dublin.

I’m a creative at heart. I’m also a bit of a data and privacy nerd. I aim to wield tech for good.

I’ve been living in London for the last 6 years. In that time I’ve worked with some amazing teams on challenges surrounding [open data](https://theodi.org/) and [privacy / security](https://projectsbyif.com/).

Until recently I was a Developer at [Projects by IF](https://projectsbyif.com/). Right now I’m freelancing as a Developer and Creative Producer while polishing some of my technical skills.

If you're interested in any of the above and think that you've a role / project you'd like to talk to me about, then drop me a line - [plangphoto@gmail.com](mailto:plangphoto@gmail.com).

## Skills

#### Creativity

I lean towards creativity and enjoy making and breaking things (and then quickly fixing them). The level of creativity that I work on is spread across both the creation of content / projects / systems and straight forward problem solving.

Taking a look at the projects attached to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/langphil/) profile and the ones showcased on my [Blog](https://langp.me/blog/) will give you a better idea of my focus.

As I have spent time in two early stage companies where processes were being established I was able to wield my creativity to try new ways of doing things and enshrine them in new systems and processes.

#### Technical Ability

Technology is a tool. In the same way that a camera gives me the ability to act creatively, so to does Technology.

My experience has typically been in Front End Web Development. Employing technologies like WordPress Multisite and Static Site generators like Jekyll. I also have experience in design, paper prototyping and rapid development of HTML prototypes.

At the moment I'm focussed on Object Orientated Programming. I've previously employed languages like Python when working on personal projects.

Some self initiated projects that you may be interested in can be found in the [Projects](#projects) section below.

#### Delivery

All of the skills above that I have mentioned can quickly become useless if you are unable to deliver.
I've a long track record of working in busy work environments with multiple projects that have distinct delivery times.

My time at the ODI was one full of diversity of projects, that crossed a spectrum of technical, content production, administrative, and event production. Context switching was a common feature of my days. Managing these projects and ensuring delivery on time was a skill I developed and continue to hone.

#### Additional Skills

- Learning: "Always be learning" is a life approach I adopt. I'm keen to pick up new skills and understand how the world works.
- Listening: I enjoy other people and their stories. Listening is an important skill and I try to put a lot of emphasis on it.
- Living: I pause to stop and breath. It's a good skill.
